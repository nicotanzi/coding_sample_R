# Sample Data Manipulation in R
 I participated in a project for the CEDH (UdeSA), where we used the 
 <a hreflang="https://mics.unicef.org/surveys">MISC survey of UNICEF</a>
	for Argentina. It provides a large dataset about households and
	individuals about a broad set of variables (related to education,
	economic status, health, belief, violence exposure, etc).
	The main goal of the project was to use this data to build
	a predictive model of some key variables, such as domestic violence,
	school dropout, teeneage pregnancy, etc.<br>
	Before the fun stuff, we have to transform the raw dataset into
	a more cmoprenhensive and operable dataset. This fragment of code
	shows how from a precise understanding of the survey, it could be possible
	to construct a the number of repeated years of every child.
